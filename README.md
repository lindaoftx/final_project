# Final Project

## Topic
Predicting airline delays

### Why was this topic selected? 
In addition to general interest from all group members on the topic of travel, we chose this topic because it allowed for multiple clear, binary questions to explore with our data analysis. As a group, we believe we will be able to create an accurate model to predict airline delays given the datasets we have found. 

## Data sources

### Machine learning data

- https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhishek211119/2015-flight-delays-and-cancellation-prediction/notebook

### Additional analysis data
- Regions are defined by US Census regions and divisions. [\[source\]](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf)
- Holidays are defined by the Federal Office of Personnel Management. [\[source\]](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/#url=2022)
- Airline hubs are defined as the primary hub, operating base, or headquarters when an airline has multiple hubs. 
- Airline size data [\[source\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_airlines_in_North_America)

## The question we hope to answer
Given user-provided variables, will the flight be delayed?
- Airport from
- Airport to
- Day of week
- Time of day [morning/afternoon/evening]
- Airline

## Additional analysis questions we hope to answer
1. Is there one day of the week that is most likely to have delays? 
2. Are flights more likely to be delayed in the afternoon/evening? 
3. Are flights more likely to be delayed at large airports/major hubs or smaller regional airports? 
4. Does the size of the airline affect delays?
- Fleet size
- Passenger volume
- Number of destinations
- Number of daily departures
5. Do “low cost” airlines have more delays than the “full service” airlines?
6. Are airports located within major metropolitan areas more likely to have delays than airports located more than airports located within 30 miles of the city center? 
7. Are airport delays more likely in a region of the country? 
8. How do cargo-only airlines compare to passenger airlines? 
9. Rate of holiday delay vs. normal day delays
