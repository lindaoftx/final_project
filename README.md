## Why was this topic selected? 
In addition to general interest from all group members on the topic of travel, we chose this topic because it allowed for multiple clear, binary questions to explore with our data analysis. As a group, we believe we will be able to create an accurate model to predict airline delays given the datasets we have found. 

## Data sources
We chose to narrow our data set to help focus the information our model would "learn" in the hopes it would increase accuracy of the model. Our data was narrowed to: 
- One specific airport: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)
- Seven airlines:
    - "Full Service" airlines: American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines
    - "Low Cost" airlines: JetBlue and Southwest
    - "Ultra-Low Cost" airlines: Frontier and Spirit
- The year 2022 only 

Our data was all pulled from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Departures.aspx

## The question we hope to answer
Given user-provided variables, will the flight be delayed?
- Airport from
- Day of week
- Time of day [morning/afternoon/evening]
- Airline

## Additional analysis questions we hope to answer
1. Is there one day of the week that is most likely to have delays? 
2. Are flights more likely to be delayed in the afternoon/evening? 
3. Does the size of the airline affect delays?
    * Fleet size
    * Passenger volume
    * Number of destinations
    * Number of daily departures
4. Do “low cost” airlines have more delays than the “full service” airlines?
5. Rate of holiday delay vs. normal day delays

## Communication process
Our team utilized a private Slack channel and Zoom conferences to communicate about the project. We created shared google docs to track all of the components of the project and track deliverables. 

Team roles were delegated based on team members' most and least desired role with the understanding that all team members would be available to collaborate and assist as needed in each role. To streamline GitHub, each part of the project has an assigned "point person" responsible for confirming all code in the branches is production ready, then merging the code into the main branch.
